    <p>Mixin provides messaging, transferring cryptocurrencies, and other services to users around the world. Our Privacy Policy helps explain our information (including message) practices. For example, we talk about what information we collect and how this affects you. We also explain the steps we take to protect your privacy â€“ like building Mixin so delivered messages aren't stored and giving you control over who you communicate with on our Services.</p>
    <p>When we say "Mixin," "our," "we," or "us," we're talking about Mixin Limited. This Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") applies to all of our apps, services, features, software, and website (together, "Services") unless specified otherwise.</p>
    <p>Please also read Mixin's Terms of Service ("Terms"), which describes the terms under which you use our Services.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Mixin receives or collects information when we operate and provide our Services, including when you install, access, or use our Services.</p>

    <h2>Information You Provide</h2>
    <p>Your Account Information. You provide your mobile phone number to create a Mixin account. You provide us the phone numbers in your mobile address book on a regular basis, including those of both the users of our Services and your other contacts. You confirm you are authorized to provide us such numbers. You may also add other information to your account, such as a profile name, profile picture, and status message.</p>
    <p>Your Messages. We do not retain your messages in the ordinary course of providing our Services to you. Once your messages (including your chats, photos, videos, voice messages, and files) are delivered, they are deleted from our servers. Your messages are stored on your own device. If a message cannot be delivered immediately (for example, if you are offline), we may keep it on our servers for up to 30 days as we try to deliver it. If a message is still undelivered after 30 days, we delete it. We also offer end-to-end encryption for our Services. End-to-end encryption means that your messages are encrypted to protect against us and third parties from reading them.</p>
    <p>Customer Support. You may provide us with information related to your use of our Services, including copies of your messages, and how to contact you so we can provide you customer support. For example, you may send us an email with information relating to our app performance or other issues.</p>

    <h2>Automatically Collected Information</h2>
    <p>Usage and Log Information. We collect service-related, diagnostic, and performance information. This includes information about your activity (such as how you use our Services, how you interact with others using our Services, and the like), log files, and diagnostic, crash, website, and performance logs and reports.</p>
    <p>Device and Connection Information. We collect device-specific information when you install, access, or use our Services. This includes information such as hardware model, operating system information, browser information, IP address, mobile network information including phone number, and device identifiers.</p>
    <p>Cookies. We use cookies to operate and provide our Services, including to provide our Services that are web-based, improve your experiences, understand how our Services are being used, and customize our Services. For example, we use cookies to provide Mixin for web and desktop and other web-based services. We may also use cookies to understand which of our FAQs are most popular and to show you relevant content related to our Services. Additionally, we may use cookies to remember your choices, such as your language preferences, and otherwise to customize our Services for you. Learn more about how we use cookies to provide you our Services.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Information</h2>
    <p>Information Others Provide About You. We receive information other people provide us, which may include information about you. For example, when other users you know use our Services, they may provide your phone number from their mobile address book (just as you may provide theirs), or they may send you a message, send messages to groups to which you belong, or call you.</p>
    <p>Third-Party Services. We allow you to use our Services in connection with third-party services. If you use our Services with such third-party services, we may receive information about you from them; for example, if you use the Mixin share button on a news service to share a news article with your Mixin contacts, groups, or broadcast lists on our Services, or if you choose to access our Services through a mobile carrier's or device provider's promotion of our Services. Please note that when you use third-party services, their own terms and privacy policies will govern your use of those services.</p>
